OPUS INSTALLATION NOTES

Here are rough installation notes for OPUS 3.3.0. Remember, one of the major
things we are working on for version 4.0.0 is an easier installation route.
Version 4 of both the PDSystem and OPUS are expected late in August or
early in September.

Sorry about that!

1. Decide whether to install the PDSystem

The PDSystem, designed to handle students' personal development, is the sister
application for OPUS. In recent years OPUS has disabled some of its internal
handling for things like CVs in favour of tight integration of the PDSystem.
This will change for version 4.0.0. In the meantime, if you really want all
the clever CV handling you are strongly advised to install the PDSystem also.
Refer to http://foss.ulster.ac.uk/projects/pdsystem/ for more details.

2. Are you running Debian?

If you are running Debian GNU/Linux this installation will be MUCH more
automatic, including making the database for you. Add the following line
to /etc/apt/sources.list

  deb http://foss.ulster.ac.uk/debian stable main

and then simply run aptitude install opus (or use your favourite package
management tool). You can then shortcut most of this (but packaging is
a bit experimental at the moment), except the pear dependencies perhaps.

3. Unpack the archive

OK, so if you are reading this, you probably already followed this step.
Unpack the files to somewhere sensible for your site architecture. For
example, /usr/share/opus would be a good place for most flavours of Linux
and maybe some unixes too.

4. Ensure requirements are installed and working

Do you have a functional web server, with PHP 5 running, as well as a
MySQL server and so on? Have you downloaded Smarty from

http://smarty.php.net and installed it somewhere?

Configuring fine details on these packages is outside the scope of this
document, but there are thousands of help documents on the internet for this.

Install pear (http://pear.php.net) and

  pear install DB
  pear install Mail
  pear install Mail_Mime

5. Get the Web Server to see the pages

You want your web server to see the "html" directory in the archive. Here are three
ways to achieve this:

  a) copy the directory underneath your htdocs or other directory root;
  b) make a symbolic link to the html directory along the lines of
     ln -s /var/www/opus /usr/share/opus/html
     obviously your paths will vary
  c) configure the web server directly.

The third is probably the easiest. The etc directory contains a sample apache 2
configuration file that can be dropped into your apache conf.d directory, but be
sure to edit the file for paths. If you choose option a) or b) you will need to
use another option, like an .htaccess file or equivalent to make your include
path point at your smarty installation, and the include directory for opus.

6. Make the OPUS database

Use MySQL to create a new database. Details vary but something like:

  mysql -u root -p
  (type password for mysql root user)
  create database opus;
  grant all on opus.* to opus_user@localhost identified by 'password_here';
  source /usr/share/opus/sql_patch/schema.sql
  source /usr/share/opus/sql_patch/data.sql

  amend paths as needed.

7. Set up Smarty templating

The templates directory are used by Smarty, you should create

  templates_c
  templates_cache

directories also, which need to be writeable by your web server user.
For example

  chown root:www-data templates_*
  chmod 770 templates_*

Smarty will then be able to make files in here.

8. Set up Log files

Similarly, you need a directory somewhere which is writable by the web server
to contain the OPUS log files. Create one of your choice.

9. Edit the configuration file

Go to the include directory and use config.php.dist as a template for
config.php (cp config.php.dist config.php), and edit the file appropriately.
It is reasonably well commented. Debian will do most of this automatically.

10. Try to login

This should create an admin account with username "admin" and password "password".
OBVIOUSLY IF YOU CAN LOGIN YOU SHOULD CHANGE THIS PASSWORD!

This is probably all for now. There should be more to do to enable certain periodic
cleanup code, but that hasn't been released into the foss server yet and will be
in 4.0.0 if not before.
