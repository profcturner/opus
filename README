This code is somewhere between versions 3.2 and 3.3 of OPUS. I'd hoped to
complete 3.3 before the date of 27th February when I promised I'd release
code but that hasn't been possible. As a result, the code is not
immediately useful, but 3.2 contains a lot of redundant code that I would
prefer not to release.

I'm releasing this today to prove we (the University of Ulster) mean business.
Over the next week or so, 3.3 will be complete and all development will now
take place from this server, so you'll see the live version. When a stable
version is complete, I will tag it as such and make an announcement.

When appropriate I will create some install scripts and instructions, and as
you may notice, some debian packages.

Sorry for the interim status.

There is a small amount of 3rd party code in here, which should be distributable
under the GPL licence, I will highlight more of this soon.
