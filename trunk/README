So here is the first release of code that is a major milestone version
for what we use here at the University of Ulster.

I made too many changes for this version to trial things for version 4
which is due in August / September, and it has delayed this release. Sorry
about that.

Even at this, there are still a few historical issues I'm resolving. Namely:
OPUS was originally designed as a standalone application, and then integrated
with the PDSystem. This means the integration is "too tight" in places if you
plan to run OPUS alone. This will be resolved for version 4.0.

I repeat, you should see this version as one to install and play with. Version
4.0 will be

  * ironically, simpler to install;
  * easier to run standalone without the PDSystem;
  * fundamentally more solid and maintainable.

Note that this version will resemble version 4.0 very closely in interface and
functionality, so there will not be a large learning curve.

So, feel free to play with this version, but we expect you to run 4.0 when we
release it for our internal use in late August / early September. Of course,
the updates will also be released under the GNU GPL v2 and so will be
free. We haven't yet talked about upgrading to GPL v3, but that might happen.

There is a small amount of 3rd party code in here, which should be distributable
under the GPL licence, I will highlight more of this soon.
