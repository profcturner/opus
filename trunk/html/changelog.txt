Changes in V2.0.2

* A strange bug appeared where dates entered into the closing date of a vacancy
  where zeroed. This seems to have coincided with an upgrade of both PHP and
  MySQL, so a change of behaviour in one of them might have caused this bug to
  appear.
  
  The code has now been fixed.

Changes in V2.0.1

* Timelines are now updated every hour

* Company searches now honour the activity type buttons (this
  was broken, but possibly not noticed since vacancies are now
  the focal point.)
  
* In the company editor, the link to launch company web pages
  was broken. This is now fixed.

* In the student statistics, PMS now handles the situation more gracefully
  when a user asks for a course report but does not select an assessment 
  regime.
  
* When an administrator views a student's home page, the PMS used to use the
  logged in user (administrator's) last login time to decide how to show
  the modified companies. It now fetches the last access time for the student
  on this page to more accurately show what the student will see.

Changes in V2.0.0

General Features
==========

* Dynamic Help Directory

  Attempts to work out from context which admins can help with a student,
  activity etc. It is possible to toggle which admins should appear in the
  directory.
  
* Use of more of PDS style sheet

  Moving to use the red borders for cells in which data entry is required in
  more places.

* Assessment support

  Assessment support overhauled to make new assessments easier to add,
  also students can now use this to file health and safety checklists.
  This will allow supporting new regimes simpler, but as yet I haven't had
  the time to support (make the forms for) other regimes than SEME. Some
  resource would allow other regimes to be supported.
  
  Menus can be switched off for better printing of assessment forms.
  
  Students will see the forms that will be filled in, and for completed assessment
  the form exactly as it was populated.
  
  As before, all entry is validated and improper entries will be rejected, but
  upon successful filing of the assessment, there will now be a grace
  period of 24 hours for the assessor to modify it (still requiring valid data).
  Relevant Administrators will be able to modify it after that point. The system
  tracks modification times.
  
  Student Health & Safety checklist is in the SEME regime for now, but can
  easily be added for others that want it.

  
Student Features
==========

* Student integration with PDS

  The student view will now appear as a seamless tab on the PDSystem. 
  Students logging in via the PDS will move straight to their PMS home
  page if they have a used on the PMS. At this time other students
  will see other information about placement, since we cannot have
  unsupported students on the PMS.
  
  Admins browsing as a student will see the old look and feel for now.

* Student help pages

  Using the help links that exist at the top of the page in the PDS,
  students in the PMS will see appropriate help for each page.
  
* Student notes

  Students can finally file and see notes.

* Enhanced placement record features

  Students can now edit their work email and phone for each
  placement (multiple placements can be recorded).

  Students will enter in details for their academic tutor, which (if an
  email is supplied) will trigger a new user to be created and sent to the
  supervisor.
  
  
Company Features
===========

* Links to features are more prominent

  The links to edit the basic details, vacancies etc have been made more
  prominent.
  
* HTML Editor changes

  The HTML editor for editing briefs has been in the PMS since V1.1, but
  a few irregularities have been corrected where it did not fire up. Similarly
  more help is given to companies about errors that may occur in
  rendering.  

* Company Activities Simpler

  Activities are no longer specified on a year by year basis, making it
  simpler to manage. They have been moved to checkboxes in the
  basic record editor. Vacancies are now the indicator of whether companies
  are taking students in a given year.

* Vacancy support improved

  Vacancies now have their own tab (since activities are now moved into
  the basic details), and new vacancies can be cloned from old ones, in
  order to help add new vacancies that are similar to last year's or
  another offered that year.

  It is possible to show all vacancies provided or just those for a given
  academic year.

  Filling in a start date is now compulsory to help the system determine
  which vacancies are appropriate for given students. Forms are clarified
  and more help text added.

* Student list for vacancies enhanced

  On the student list for a vacancy there is now a link to have the CV
  emailed to you, and a help link for each student for the help directory.

  Changing status for a student triggers a dialog allowing an email to be
  entered for the student (e.g. interview date).

Administrator Features
==============  
  
* Other classes too!

  As usual, admin users can exploit 99% of the features mentioned here
  for other classes.

* Admin student features

  New timelines are added both for individual student viewing in the
  status, and can be switched on for a search in the advanced search.
  These show at a glance patterns of application, number of companies
  applied for and status (required, placed or other).

  Each student listed in the advanced search has a link to their help
  directory, to help higher level admins find who can help with them.

  In the advanced search listed students can be checked and an email sent
  to them.

* Placement record features

  PMS V2 supports multiple placement records for those students made
  redundant and (re)placed, as well as for students with multiple placements.

  As with students, adding details (email) for an industrial supervisor
  will trigger a new user to be created and sent to the supervisor.
  
* Home page bugs fixed

  Some links to new companies and vacancies didn't work correctly in the
  admin home page, this is now fixed.

Academic Tutor Features
===============

* Improved view of students

  The new student view shows much more information for students, and
  can show multiple records. It also shows the industrial supervisor if
  present.
  
  The contact shown defaults to that one who created the vacancy the
  placement came from.
  
  Links to the company and vacancy record are provided for research.
  
Supervisor Features
============
  
* Supervisor support

  Supervisors will be able to login, one record per placement, and see the
  basic student details, academic tutor contact details, appropriate
  resources, and any assessments they need to carry out.
