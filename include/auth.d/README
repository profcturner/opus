This directory is used to hold objects that can authenticate a user.

For all but the simplest set ups, where OPUS is standalone, you will probably
want to adjust the contents of this directory to allow single sign on, etc..

Only files with the format nn_classname.php or nn_classname.class.php will be
loaded from this directory, and these will be loaded in the order of the numbers
"nn". Although this is "expensive" it is only done until a user is logged in.

Each file contains a class from which an object is created. It has a function
that returns a valid username to load from if authentication fails, and false
otherwise.

You could use this approach to validate from cookies, LDAP or anything else.
To disable an authentication plugin, just rename it to have, for example, .disabled
on the end.
