######### Language Prompts for OPUS (Localised)
#
# To edit various text appearing in the OPUS system, duplicate the lookup
# (and appropriate sectioning) from lang_en.conf in this file and set your new
# version. Do NOT edit lang_en.conf directly, if you do, it will get clobbered
# during upgrades.
#
# This file should either be in the configs directory, or symlinked there.
# This is handled automatically on Debian.
