# This file is intended to be installed in the Debian packaging, paths

# You will need to restart Apache for changes to take effect.

# OPUS uses tinymce as an HTML editor, the Debian package does not
# provide an alias, so without this next section it will not work out
# of the box. Comment this out if you need to.

		# DEBUG VALUES
		#
		# On a production server, OPUS should not show sensitive information
		# on errors. However, you may wish to, or be asked to, change these
		# values to help determine bugs. Developers will probably want to
		# change these.
		#
		# You will need to restart Apache for these to take effect, and don't
		# forget to change it back afterwards.

		# By default, don't show errors on screen, if you have a "white screen" try changing this to "on"

    # It can be handy to log errors, especially if you don't display them, so uncomment the following
