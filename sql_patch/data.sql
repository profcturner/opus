INSERT INTO `help` VALUES (1,'XMLSyntax',NULL,NULL,'Guidance on how to write XML code','In some cases where you may need to enter a considerable quantity of text in\r\nsome fields the website it is often desireable for you to have\r\nsome control over the formatting of that text.\r\n<BR/>\r\n\r\nFor this purpose some XML style tags (similar to HTML) are permitted in these fields.\r\nIf you have some familiarity with HTML you should find this very easy to deal\r\nwith. Of course you need not use any tags at all, but in this case the website\r\nwill format the text as it sees fit.\r\n<BR/>\r\n\r\n<h4>Tag format</h4>\r\n\r\nJust as in HTML, the tags take the form of a control word encased between &lt; and\r\n&gt;. For example\r\n\r\n<BR/><BR/><TT>\r\n&lt;CENTER&gt;\r\n</TT>\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n\r\nwill cause all text following it to appear centered in the screen. This effect will\r\nstop when the corresponding tag\r\n\r\n<BR/><BR/><TT>\r\n&lt;/CENTER&gt;\r\n</TT>\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n\r\nis met in the text.\r\n\r\n<h4>Centred text</h4>\r\n\r\nAs just desribed, to cause some text to appear in the center of the available space, place it between\r\nthe tags\r\n\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n<TT>&lt;CENTER&gt;This will appear in the centre.&lt;/CENTER&gt;</TT>\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n\r\nNote that although CENTER is spelt in the American manner here, the British\r\nEnglish CENTRE is also supported.\r\n\r\n<h4>Titles</h4>\r\n\r\nIf you wish to provide a subtitle for some text to follow, place it between the tags\r\n\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n<TT>&lt;TITLE&gt;This will appear as a title.&lt;/TITLE&gt;</TT>\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n\r\n<h4>Type-writer formatting</h4>\r\n\r\nIf you want a section of text to appear in fixed-width fonts (because you want\r\nsome elements to line up for example) use the tags\r\n\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n<TT>&lt;PRE&gt;This will appear in fixed width.&lt;/PRE&gt;</TT>\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n\r\nIn fact this set of tags means that text between them should appear exactly as\r\nyou have typed it, complete with new lines. For those people more familiar with HTML tags the tags <TT>&lt;TT&gt;</TT> and \r\n<TT>&lt;/TT&gt;</TT> are also\r\nsupported with their original meaning.\r\n\r\n<h4>Taking a new line</h4>\r\n\r\nWhen you take a new line in the field window this does not mean the displayed text\r\nwill take a new line. This is to allow you to split lines to make them easy to\r\nread in the small window.\r\nIf you want to force a new line simply use<BR/><BR/>\r\n\r\n<TT>&lt;BR&gt;</TT> or the more correct <TT>&lt;BR/&gt;</TT>\r\n\r\nbut both forms are supported.\r\n\r\n<h4>Bold text</h4>\r\n\r\nIf you wish to emphasis a small section of text by making it bold (not necessary for titles please note) then you can use the following.\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n\r\n<TT>&lt;B&gt;</TT>This will be bold.\r\n<TT>&lt;/B&gt;</TT><BR/>\r\n\r\n<h4>Example</h4>\r\n\r\nHere is a sample of how the notes field for a course might be formatted.\r\n\r\n<BR/><BR/>\r\n<TT>\r\n&lt;CENTER&gt;<BR/>\r\n&lt;TITLE&gt;Placement Opportunity&lt;/TITLE&gt;<BR/>\r\nWe are happy to announce that we at<BR/>\r\n&lt;B&gt;MicroBanana&lt;/B&gt; are looking<BR/>\r\nfor engineering students to help push<BR/>\r\nforward our ground-breaking research<BR/>\r\nin micro-integrated bananas.<BR/>\r\n&lt;/CENTER&gt;<BR/>\r\n&lt;BR/&gt;<BR/>\r\nMore information is given below.<BR/>\r\n&lt;PRE&gt;<BR/>\r\n<PRE>Job                             Salary\r\nBanana Manufacturing Engineer   20 bananas per month\r\nBanana Research Engineer        25 bananas per month</PRE>\r\n&lt;/PRE&gt;<BR>\r\n</TT>\r\n\r\nThis will appear as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Placement Opportunity</h4>\r\nWe are happy to announce that we at\r\n<B>MicroBanana</B> are looking\r\nfor engineering students to help push\r\nforward our ground-breaking research\r\nin micro-integrated bananas.\r\n\r\n<BR/>\r\nMore information is given below.\r\n<PRE>\r\n\r\nJob                             Salary\r\nBanana Manufacturing Engineer   20 bananas per month\r\nBanana Research Engineer        25 bananas per month\r\n</PRE>\r\n',1),(1,'ContactCompanyBasic',NULL,NULL,'Company Editor Basics tab (Contacts)','test',2),(1,'CompanyBasic',NULL,NULL,'Company Editor Basic tab','You can use this form to edit the company brief.\r\nIt is possible to use some special codes to help\r\nimprove the layout of the information when it is shown.<BR/>\r\nNote that when you make alterations to your entry\r\nthe system will automatically notify students that\r\nlogin to the system that your information has\r\nbeen updated.',3),(1,'ContactHome',0,'','Company Contact Home Page, first few paragraphs','<p>Welcome to OPUS - the management system for all aspects of work-integrated learning and placement.<br /><br /> If you need more information or help on finding students for your opportunity or advertising your vacancies please contact our staff by using the help directory link at the bottom of the page.<br /><br /> You can use this site to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>edit the details about your company that you wish to advertise to students;</li>\r\n<li>add and edit information about placement vacancies you wish to offer;</li>\r\n<li>view and edit information about the contacts who act for your company;</li>\r\n<li>view lists of students applying for your vacancy online, invite a shortlist to interview and inform them of your decisions;</li>\r\n<li>view RESOURCES using the menu on the left to get more information about our courses and placement procedures;</li>\r\n<li>and more.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Please do not hesitate to ask us for help if you need it.</p>',8),(1,'AdminLogViewer',NULL,'admin','Instructions for log viewing script','<B>Instructions</B><BR>\r\nThe placement system creates several log files\r\nin the course of its normal operation.
