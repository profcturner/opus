OPUS 4.0.0 - Release Notes

This release of OPUS is one of the most significant in several years, partly
since the application has been completely rewritten. Therefore it is more
important that usual to read these notes carefully to understand any
ramifications to your installed application.

Notes for Users
---------------

For most users of the system, the changes will appear to be mainly visual.
User interfaces should be more consistent and simple, and more visually
attractive. Nevertheless, there are some minor changes to note.

* OPUS now has a system of preferences for each user. Most of these are
  accessible from the "preferences" option in the top right of the screen.
  Some, however, are automatically used and saved. For example, now OPUS
  remembers all your settings in the main, and complex, search forms, and
  will continue to use those settings when you return to the form in the
  same session. If you correctly logout (using the option in the top right
  of the screen), OPUS will save these preferences for use in your next
  session.

* The menus have been completely reimplemented, and we are aware that they
  do not perform as well as we would like under some especially non CSS
  compliant browsers (e.g. Internet Explorer before version 7).

* Students will now be able to record applications they make to special
  vacancies, these can't be automatically verified but are still useful as
  a recording tool hopefully.

* OPUS now knows about Faculties, which should simplify administration of
  big systems. In the past administrators could be allocated to programmes
  or schools, but this is now extended to Faculties and the insitution at
  large which can be useful for faculty staff and staff from central departments.


Notes for System Administrators
-------------------------------

This version of OPUS should be, by far, the simplest to install and maintain
yet. However there are some points to note.

* OPUS now runs on a common framework with the PDSystem, and other planned
  applications for the future. This framework UUWAF, is required to be
  installed before OPUS can work.

  UUWAF requires PHP with a version beyond 5.1, this is because it uses the
  PDO functionality within PHP which was bundled in the core from that version on.
  Therefore OPUS will no longer run on PHP 4, but please note PHP 4 is no longer
  a supported product by PHP itself.

  The benefit of this is that database access is now very normalised, and it is
  in fact probably possible (but untested and unrecommended) to move OPUS to any
  database layer supported by PDO (including Oracle and Postgresql).

* The database is so radically changed that the upgrade procedure is slightly more
  complex that usual, consisting of an initial SQL patch, a PHP script to migrate
  data, and finishing with another upgrade patch. Read the instructions in the
  sql_patch directory very carefully if you are upgrading from 3.x.

* The configuration file for OPUS is very much more simple, but radically
  different from previous versions. You should check the whole configuration file
  very carefully. Note that, to make upgrades simple, you should create, and
  modify a local copy of the config file as directed, so that global configuration
  options are preserved on upgrade.

* Authentication handling in OPUS 4 is much more flexible, being handled by the
  framework. There is a directory, include/auth.d which holds "plugins" for
  authentication. The README file in that directory will explain how to enable
  various authentication sources, and how to write your own plugins.

* The cron framework for version 4 is no longer standalone code, but uses the same
  model business logic layer. It can also provide some useful command line tools for
  OPUS. Try "./opus.php help" in the cron directory for more information.
