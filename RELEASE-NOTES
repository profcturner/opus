OPUS 4.1.0 - Release Notes

Please read the following notes for issues before upgrading your
OPUS installation.

Notes for Users
---------------

* A number of errors on navigation, mostly cosmetic have been corrected.
  Various inconsistencies in navigation have also been fixed.
  
* A handful of pages that showed no page title or tagline have been
  identified and fixed.
  
* The navigation for staff users has been simplified considerable and a
  number of options that weren't allowed by policy anyway removed from
  the menus.
  
* Bugs causing slow performances in textareas in some browsers have been
  fixed (bug #371).
  
* Some minor errors in photograph retrieval and display have been
  corrected (bug #412). Photos are also displayed in some other areas
  as appropriate.
  
* fixed some minor issues with workflow when maniulating placements,
  and a harmless SQL error on placement manipulation has been removed
  (bug #391).
  
* The manual, while still rather incomplete, is vastly more complete
  than it was for version 4.0.2. You can install the manual on Debian
  by selecting the package opus-doc, or download it from the project
  website.
  
* The ability to configure other assessors that existed in 3.x has been
  reinstated.
  
* A number of problems editing assessment structures have been
  identified and fixed, and textareas in assessments now show character
  counters.
  
* Minor permission problems have been found and fixed.

* We have added a commented out line in the supplied apache2.conf for
  Ubuntu which stores Smarty in a slightly different place.
  
* CV group descriptions did not "stick" when changed which has been
  fixed.
  
* OPUS now can automatically create notes for the logged in user on
  certain actions. For example, it now stores placement status changes
  for users in notes.
  
* Companies now have a place for Health & Safety compliance to be
  recorded, which are stored in notes automatically upon changes.
  
* A problem was identified when associations between administrators and
  various academic units were removed, and has been fixed.
  
* CVs can now be emailled, several at a time (bug #390).

* Student's can now have their internal CV store manipulated by
  administrators on their behalf. This is true even for OPUS / PDSystem
  combination systems.
  
* Instructions for dealing with applicant lists have been expanded and
  clarified.
  
* Vacancy lists can now be sorted by closing date.

* The popup calendar has been changed to one with no license issues.

* Various minor fixes in the reporting functionality, augmentation to
  the existing student broadsheet to include placement email, and a new
  report has been added to show which companies we have had vacancies
  with.
  
* A number of new fields have been added to the student entry, including
  address fields. A "quick note" has been added that allows a number of
  keywords to be attached to a student. Students can then be searched
  for by this field in the student directory.
  
* A few minor problems with cookies have been found and solved.

Notes for Administrators
------------------------

* OPUS now requires version 1.1.0 or higher of the UU Web Application
  Framework. If you have not yet upgraded that, do this first. You can
  find it at
  
  http://foss.ulster.ac.uk/projects/uuwaf/downloads/
  
  but note that the Debian packaging will handle this automatically.
  
* OPUS now uses tiny_mce and not xinha as an embedded HTML editor, the
  Debian packages now use the Debian packaged tiny_mce and not an
  inbuilt version. Note that this might result in textareas not showing
  in the editor in your Apache configuration does not contain an alias
  for tiny_mce. If this happens add the following, or with
  appropriately changed paths and restart apache.
  
  Alias /tinymce/ /usr/share/tinymce/www/
  <Directory "/usr/share/tinymce/www/">
    Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
  </Directory>
  
* Some installations reported a PHP version that should support a date
  parsing function, but did not have that function. A workaround has
  been added.

* OPUS can now, within in its log viewer, handle compressed log files
  in a totally transparent manner.
  
  We also provide a sample configuration for log rotation to compress
  files automatically, which allows a very large history to be
  maintained, easily searched and not take up excessive disk space. The
  Debian packages will automatically enable log rotation.

* A new configuration option allows students to be emailled upon their
  account creation (optionally). To enable this, add the following line
  to your local configuration file.
  
  $config['opus']['email_students_on_creation'] = true;

* The standard CSV mapping now has one more, ninth parameter, which is
  optionally a different username from the reg_number. It can be safely
  left blank. You may need to adjust the replacement field of any
  existing mapping, by adding
  
  ,""
  
  to it. A number of issues with the CSV handling have been improved or
  fixed.
