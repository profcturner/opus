OPUS 4.0.0 - Release Notes

This release of OPUS is one of the most significant in several years, partly
since the application has been completely rewritten. Therefore it is more
important that usual to read these notes carefully to understand any
ramifications to your installed application.

Notes for Users

For most users of the system, the changes will appear to be mainly visual.
User interfaces should be more consistent and simple, and more visually
attractive. Nevertheless, there are some minor changes to note.

* OPUS now has a system of preferences for each user. Most of these are
  accessible from the "preferences" option in the top right of the screen.
  Some, however, are automatically used and saved. For example, now OPUS
  remembers all your settings in the main, and complex, search forms, and
  will continue to use those settings when you return to the form in the
  same session. If you correctly logout (using the option in the top right
  of the screen), OPUS will save these preferences for use in your next
  session.

* The menus have been completely reimplemented, and we are aware that they
  do not perform as well as we would like under some especially non CSS
  compliant browsers (e.g. Internet Explorer before version 7).
  
Notes for System Administrators

This version of OPUS should be, by far, the simplest to install and maintain
yet. However there are some points to note.

* OPUS now runs on a common framework with the PDSystem, and other planned
  applications for the future. This framework UUWAF, is required to be
  installed before OPUS can work.

  UUWAF requires PHP with a version beyond 5.1, this is because it uses the
  PDO functionality within PHP which was bundled in the core from that version on.
  Therefore OPUS will no longer run on PHP 4, but please note PHP 4 is no longer
  a supported product by PHP itself.
