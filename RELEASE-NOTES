OPUS 4.2 - Release Notes

Please read the following notes for issues before upgrading your
OPUS installation. These notes only discuss changes from 4.2. You should
NOT upgrade straight to 4.2 from a version before 4.1.1 unless you are using
the Debian packaging. Or at least read the release notes from intervening
versions.

This is a relatively minor update.

Notes for Users
---------------

* Search for companies is more limited on an initial login to prevent
  years of data being presented.
  
* Appropriate users can now change the assessment regime for a whole
  school at a time (see "bulk change assessment" button) in the
  programme listing for a whole school. Use with caution.
  
* New report added: Contact List

* A new set of statistical reports is added on the information menu for
  admin users.  
  
* Students tagged as placed can now apply again for vacancies, once
  their placement has expired.

* Self service password recovery has been added, this can be disabled
  completely, or for various classes of users.
  
* Emails to Workplace Supervisors now specify the student supervised
  since many supervisors deal with multiple students (and OPUS gives
  one account for each).

Notes for Administrators
------------------------

* A command line interface has been added to copy assessement data from
  one regime to another. This is not documented (deliberately) and
  shouldn't be used unless really needed.

* Removed references to an internal goto() function that is a reserved
  keyword in recent versions of PHP.
  
* Regular admin users can now edit student registration numbers, which
  can be overridden in the config file. See the README.config file in
  the include directory for more details.
  
* Old cache items were not correctly cleaned out, causing performance
  issues in some cases. A new cron task undertakes this. You may need
  to manually add this if not using packaging (look at the cron.d
  provided in etc).  
  
* A number of spurious PHP warnings silenced.  

* Considerable functionality to allow automatic creation of users if
  your webservices are sufficiently fully featured. See README.config
  in the include directory for information on how to enable and
  configure this feature.
