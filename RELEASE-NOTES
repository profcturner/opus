OPUS 5.0 - Release Notes

The main reason for this release of OPUS is to put a version in the
wild that works correctly with all new PHP and Smarty versions.

There is no data schema upgrade since version 4.2.0

There was a major cosmetic update in version 4.3.0 which while available
in source control was not packaged at that time due to some issues with
the code.

OPUS 5 sees a slow severing of links with Pace nee PDSystem which will
likely advance in subsequent minor versions.

OPUS now allows self service password recovery, but this can be
disabled for various classes of user (and is disabled by default for
root users).

I might get time to detail what has changed, but I doubt it. Sorry :-(.
