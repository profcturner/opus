OPUS 4.1.1 - Release Notes

Please read the following notes for issues before upgrading your
OPUS installation. These notes only discuss changes from 4.1.0. You should
NOT upgrade straight to 4.1.1 from a version before 4.1.0 unless you are using
the Debian packaging. Or at least read the release notes from intervening
versions.

This is a relatively minor update.

Notes for Users
---------------

* Institutional admins did not work correctly, this is fixed.

* With working web services, students can now be added automatically,
  individually with reg number, or with a file containing one reg number per
  line. This will also automatically create programmes, schools and faculties.
  
* An error with downloading internal CVs is fixed.

* OPUS is more intelligent about appending appropriate filenames to CVs based
  on their mime type when sending them in email.
  
* Fixed a bug where companies editing their own record inadvertantly wiped the
  health and safety field (though information was retained in a note).
  
* Organisational units are listed alphabetically now in the configuration menu.


Notes for Administrators
------------------------

* Minor changes to reduce harmless (but annoying) PHP warnings in some places.

* Minor update in database schema to introduce a channel for catching students
  who are added automatically.
  
* This is new code allowing a file containing counts of online users to be
  automatically dropped if required.
  
* Additionally a munin plugin has been added to etc/ that allows munin to use
  this functionality if you desire.
